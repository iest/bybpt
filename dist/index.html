<p>My background involves a mixture of gymnastics, mountain biking, fell running, mountaineering and weight lifting.</p>

<p>I have lots of energy and enthusiasm teamed with a deep interest in people, human movement and mindset.&quot;</p></div></div><div class="profile"><div class="profile__image"><img src="/images/profile_rhodri.png"></div><h2>Rhodri</h2><div class="profile__quote"><p>&quot;My sporting background extends back as far as I can remember, with sport being an instrumental part of my life from a very young age. My sporting history includes playing football for a semi-professional club as well as trials at international levels. As well as a keen footballer, during my youth days I competed to a high standard in rugby and both track and field in athletics.</p>

<p>Having a career linked to sport, fitness and wellbeing is something Iâ€™ve always strived towards, so the obvious step for me was taking a degree in this field, and I achieved this by gaining a BSc (hons) (Bachelor of Science) in Sport and Physical Education at UWIC.&quot;</p></div></div></section></div><script src="app.min.js"></script></body></html>
