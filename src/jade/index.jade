                    Whether it’s fat loss, toning, gaining muscle, improving your fitness level for an event or merely personal satisfaction; we can educate and motivate you in a fun, unintimidating environment where your goals and enjoyment are our number one priority. We pride ourselves in delivering quality advice and practical knowledge on nutritional needs paramount to weight loss as well as technical guidance and coaching for a more sport specific strength and conditioning approach.

                    With years of experience in the fitness industry we are currently based in the Roath area of Cardiff. We also cover surrounding areas reaching the more rural towns and villages bordering the city. Be Your Best Personal Training offers one to one or small group personal training sessions. These can be taken at your home, outside or at the gym.

                    If you are concerned about coming to use a public gym we can bring the gym to you! Myself and Rhodri have all the equipment needed to fulfil your training needs without you having to leave the house!

                    The outdoor sessions, often held in parks or local forestry areas can be mixed with gym sessions. They are a great way to get some fresh air and give you a different aspect to your exercise needs.

                    All gym training sessions are based in the Roath area of Cardiff in a local, friendly gym. People of all abilities are welcomed and encouraged here.

                            "With years of experience working closely on a one to one basis with my clients I have a developed a very holistic approach: firmly believing that if the cycle of sleeping, moving, eating, hydrating and managing life can be balanced correctly, our general well being will be vastly improved. Becoming fitter and healthier will greatly improve all aspects of life.

                            My background involves a mixture of mountain biking and hiking. Also gymnastics, running and weightlifting. I am a very keen mountain runner, spending much of my spare time training for various challenges; previously completing multiple day off road marathon events.

                            I have lots of energy and enthusiasm teamed with a deep interest in people, human movement and mindset."

                            "My sporting background extends back as far as I can remember, with sport being an instrumental part of my life from a very young age. My sporting history includes playing football for a semi-professional club as well as trials at international levels.

                            As well as a keen footballer, during my youth days I competed to a high standard in rugby and both track and field in athletics.
                            
                            Having a career linked to sport, fitness and wellbeing is something I’ve always strived towards, so the obvious step for me was taking a degree in this field, and I achieved this by gaining a BSc (hons) (Bachelor of Science) in Sport and Physical Education at UWIC."

                                > In the past I admit I was very lazy. I didn't push myself and got very bored. I was the only person I knew that could go to the gym for an hour and not break out a sweat. This was a total waste of time and money. Now all that has changed, I find the workouts that Lucy gets me to do are productive and motivating. I feel that I actually achieve something after each session’

                                > I have been training with Lucy Morris of “Be Your Best Personal Training” for the last 10 ½ months with the primary goal of losing weight. When I started  I weighed 13 stone 9lbs, and was officially classed as obese. My weight caused me a number of issues but it primarily affected my self-esteem. I hated seeing photographs of myself and never felt attractive – I was desperate to lose weight and very unhappy.
                                > My goal was to lose 4 stone in weight.
                                > With a combination of exercise and eating the right foods, I immediately saw the weight start to fall off.

                                > Sessions with Lucy were always varied so we didn't get bored. Some days we’d do cardio circuits that pushed us extremely hard while on other days we would  learn and perfect  new weight lifting techniques from Squats to Deadlifts.  While the sessions weren't always fun (burpees are never fun), I was never bored and always went home feeling like I had been pushed and worked hard. Losing weight provided extra motivation to keep working hard – the complements I was getting from friends and family helped too!

                                > Having tried numerous fad diets and exercising on my own nothing had previously worked.  I was initially sceptical about seeing a personal trainer but I can honestly say that it was the best decision I (well my husband) has ever made. Not only does Lucy teach you the best exercises she also educates you on the right types of food to eat. Changing habits that had developed over years were initially hard to break but Lucy was always there to motivate and offer support. 

                                > I now weight 10 s 4lbs and still have 9lbs to lose but I am very happy with my progress and the results that I have achieved so far. If someone had told me a year ago that I would be running 2km to the gym and then completing a training session involving Deadlifting 50kg and bench pressing 20kg I would have laughed at them – but that is exactly where I am and it is all thanks to Lucy! I can now fit into size 12 clothes.

                                > If you are thinking of booking personal training sessions for weight loss then I couldn’t recommend Lucy more! She is friendly, cheerful, knowledgeable, motivating, encouraging and she takes a big personal interest in her clients. Whenever I was having a bad day Lucy was there to remind me how well I was doing and to get me back on the right track. Losing the amount of weight that I have has taken time but I’ve done it the healthy way. While there has been room for the odd treat from time to time (takeaway, cake, alcohol etc) there have been some big lifestyle changes that I have implemented, all of which have definitely been worth it.

                                > I now feel much happier and more confident in myself and the way I look and I feel confident that once I reach my target weight I will be able to maintain it thanks to everything that Lucy has taught me. Don’t hesitate to book a training session with Lucy – it will be the best decision you make all year!
